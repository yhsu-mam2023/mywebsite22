# Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval
rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I
want you plot the net approval for each week in 2022, along with its 95%
confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please
use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

```{r biden_approval_plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9}

approval_polllist %>% 
  #convert end-date into "date" format:
  mutate(date_poll = mdy(enddate)) %>% 
  #extract year from date
  mutate(Year_poll = year(date_poll)) %>%
  #get week number from date 
  mutate(week_no = isoweek(date_poll)) %>%
  #filter out data for year 2022 and eliminate week 52
  filter(Year_poll== 2022, week_no != 52) %>%
  #week-wise average approval rate line plot for different sub-groups 
  group_by(subgroup,week_no) %>% 
  #get mean approval rate (difference of approve & disapprove), standard deviation of approval rate and total number   of votes in each group
  summarize(approval_rate = mean(approve - disapprove), approval_sd = sd(approve-disapprove), n = n()) %>% 
  ungroup(subgroup,week_no) %>% 
  #confidence interval
  mutate(low = approval_rate - 1.96*approval_sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  mutate(high = approval_rate + 1.96*approval_sd/sqrt(n)) %>%
  #Plot the graph of week number vs approval rate 
  ggplot(aes(x=week_no,y=approval_rate, color = subgroup))+
  geom_line()+
    facet_wrap(~subgroup, nrow = 3, strip.position = "right")+
    xlim(0,35)+
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=low,ymax=high), alpha = 0.3, fill= "orange", size = 0.8)+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    labs(title = "Biden's Net Approval Ratings in 2022",
         subtitle = "Weekly Data, Approve - Disapprove, %",
         x = "Week in 2022", 
         y = NULL,
