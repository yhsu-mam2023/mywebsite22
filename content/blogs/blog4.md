- Academic Background
Hello everyone, My name is Yung-Chieh Hsu. I’m from Taiwan and I’m one of the incoming student for MAM 2023. I have just graduated from the University of Rochester, receiving a B.A. in Financial Economics.  
- Experience
In the summer of 2021 I interned at Tiktok as a data analyst intern before and this internship has inspired me to become a Business Analyst in the future.
-Interest
Cello: I've been playing cello for 12 years and I've been in orchestra for 6 years. My favorite musics are symphonies and concerto; especially playful and sophisticated music like Tchaikovsky and Rachmaninov. 
Puzzles: When I'm super bored, I like to play 1000 pieces puzzle for the whole day. My favorite types of puzzle are puzzles that have nature and forest so I can be challenged by a bunch of puzzles in different green colors.
